This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version. The error arises from the loop condition `i <= arr.length`, which attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds. The solution adjusts the condition to `i < arr.length`, ensuring correct iteration within the array's valid indices.
